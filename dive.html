    <h1 class="stick">What is happening to our corals?</h1>
    <h2 class="stick">00</h2>
    <p>"introduction to whats happnign to our corals for years now, they have been infected by the current cliamte change slowly killing corals. Corals have a very sensitive system, that, when dirstuped unfortunatly dies. The common name for the coral turning white is called bleaching which is when a coral is affected by lack of sun and hot water."</p>

    <h1 class="stick">Why are coral important for our oceans?</h1>
    <h2 class="stick">01</h2>
    <p>"Yet coral is so sensitive that even a one- or two-degree shift in temperature can cause stress over time. When corals become stressed, they expel the symbiotic algae that live inside their exoskeletons and feed them—the very algae that keeps them alive. This expulsion causes the reef to turn a ghostly white in a process scientists call coral bleaching. Mass coral bleaching events are occurring more often and the increased frequency is having a prolonged and devastating impact on our coral reefs. "</p>

    <h1 class="stick">What is causing our corals to die?</h1>
    <h2 class="stick">02</h2>
    <p> "Climate change is the largest contributor to coral bleaching. The average global temperature has increased by at least 1.9°F (1.1°C) since 1880. Around 90% of that excess heat is being absorbed by the ocean, and higher temperatures can cause prolonged heat stress that leads to mass coral bleaching events. The ocean also helps control the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. And as the ocean absorbs excess amounts of CO2, it becomes more acidic. Coral skeletons are made of calcium carbonate, a mineral that can dissolve in acidic environments, so lower pH levels make it more difficult for coral to grow and maintain their shells. This is also true for any animal that relies on calcium carbonate structures including shelled animals like clams, oysters, and mussels, which are essential throughout the marine food chain. "</p>

    <h1 class="stick">What are the consequances of corals deaths?</h1>
    <h2 class="stick">03</h2>
    <p> "Humans also have an impact. Coral reefs need clean, clear water to survive. Plastic pollution can block sunlight, smother corals, and cause abrasions that often lead to deadly infections. Chemical pollution from sunscreen is another contributor to coral bleaching. In fact, up to 28 million pounds (12,700 metric tons) of sunscreen reaches our coral reefs each year.Most sunscreens are formulated with highly toxic ingredients like oxybenzone, which can disrupt coral’s reproduction and growth cycles, cause deformities in both coral larvae and baby corals, damage coral DNA, and contribute to abnormal skeletal growth—all of which can lead to bleaching.And that’s not just from people swimming in the ocean, either! Modern wastewater treatments don’t remove harmful chemical ingredients like oxybenzone from wastewater before it’s discharged. All water systems are connected, so the sunscreen we choose matters whether we live 10 minutes or 10,000 miles from the beach. </p>
